# Tetris GA Bot — Adaptive Evolutionary Approach

This repository contains the reference implementation for the paper:

> **E. Erkalkan**, *Heuristic Optimization of a Tetris Bot Using Genetic Algorithms: An Adaptive Evolutionary Approach*, TJMCS, 2025 (minor revision).

## Highlights
- Offline GA to learn baseline heuristic weights for a Tetris-playing agent.
- Online (in-game) dynamic reweighting driven by normalized max column height.
- Micro-GA for rapid on-the-fly adaptation (default: population 20, 5 generations).
- Headless simulators for batch experiments and logging.
- Analysis script to compute statistical significance and effect sizes.

## Installation
We recommend Python 3.10+.

```bash
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate  # Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

### 1) Run the interactive game (autoplay on a chosen sequence)
```bash
python tetris.py
```
- Choose a sequence from `tetris_sequences.txt` (100 options).
- Toggle `autoplay = True` in `__main__` (already set by default).

### 2) Baseline batch experiment (fixed weights)
```bash
python simulated_tetris_baseline.py
```
Outputs: `baseline_experiment_log.csv` (100 runs by default).

### 3) Adaptive GA experiment
```bash
python simulated_tetris.py
```
- Runs a smaller offline GA for speed, then evaluates adaptive bot.
- Outputs: `ga_experiment_log.csv` (and `ga_experiment_log_1.csv`).

### 4) Statistical analysis & plots
```bash
python analysis_stats.py
```
- Produces `stats_summary.md` (Welch t-tests, effect sizes, CIs).
- Saves histograms and boxplots to `figs/`.

## Reproducibility
- Default seeds are randomized per run; use `PYTHONHASHSEED` and set explicit `random.seed(...)` if you need strict determinism.
- Evaluation count is 100 by default; increase for tighter CIs.

## Known Fixes in This Release
- **APM mislabel**: previous code logged `apm` as total actions; now computed as `actions per minute` in simulators.
- Documentation and citation artifacts added (README, CITATION.cff, LICENSE).
- Added `requirements.txt` and an analysis script with Welch tests and effect sizes.
